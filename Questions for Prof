can u use count to provision for diff instances say tomcat, maven etc?
I was unable to cd into .aws to see d various credentials as u demonstrated.

*******using the same file i can deploy to 
#multiple e't-


monka@DESKTOP-0PEDM4P MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/terraform-series/ec2-02/ec2-03 (master)
$ cd ~/ .aws
bash: cd: too many arguments
next prof cat d credentials and saw multiple credentials


when u do terraform --version, can u explain what appears. also when u go to
aws as a provider can u also explain that similar info there.

when i do terraform fmt, i don't see d effect.

aftr creating ec2 instance, see d elastic ip, it has been assigned as d puIp
this ip will not change even if i shut down my resource bcos it is elastic.
