my terraform is not behaving as expected on d vs code. DONE
when i do terra init it does not create a terraform block as expected. DONE
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. DONE
I was unable to cd into .aws to see d various credentials as u demonstrated.
when u do terraform --version, can u explain what appears. also when u go to
aws as a provider can u also explain that similar info there.
