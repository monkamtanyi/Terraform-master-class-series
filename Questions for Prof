my terraform is not behaving as expected on d vs code. DONE
when i do terra init it does not create a terraform block as expected. DONE
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. DONE
I was unable to cd into .aws to see d various credentials as u demonstrated.
monka@DESKTOP-0PEDM4P MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/terraform-series/ec2-02/ec2-03 (master)
$ cd ~/ .aws
bash: cd: too many arguments
next prof cat d credentials and saw multiple credentials


when u do terraform --version, can u explain what appears. also when u go to
aws as a provider can u also explain that similar info there.
