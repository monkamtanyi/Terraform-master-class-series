# A simple ec2 project
1) Create a new folder /directory called: ec2-02
2) Create an ec2 instance named "FirstEC2" in your default region.
3) Use the ami of an ubuntu instance.
4) The instance size needs to be t2.micro
5) use variables to pass the ami, instance type and instance name to the resource block
6) use an output block to get the public ip address of the instance after creation

   to create an ec2 instance there are a no of ways. d first
   1) google aws_instance>takes u to  https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/3.1.0/docs/resources/instance
   since we are using aws as our provider, d naming convention always starts with aws and underscore then d resource u are looking for eg when u want to search for an ami it will be aws_ami.
b4 writhing this code,
d first thing i need to tell terra is who is my provider.
gotvscode and type provider ...

next is ur resource:
to provision an instance, u need 2 reqd aguements:
a)to create an aws instance, i need an ami. goto aws console>ec2>select ur region=ami are region
specific,>launh instance> if i want to lanch an ubuntu>click ubuntu>copy ami id and paste on your cli.
b)u also need instance type(reqd) =t2-medium etc

next pass a tag: when u provision an instance, u give it a name. that name is passed as a tag
with uppercase N. it u don't use uppercase it will appear under tag.
following terra naming covention everything is in lower cases except when u're writing names. 
we can pass multiple tags, and tags are a map bcos they are key value pairs
here d key = name, value = "FirstEC2"   d value is a string. strings are passed in " ".

provider "aws" {  #anything inside d curly brace is 
   region = "us-east-1"   #called a block- this is a provider blk
}
   
resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {  #resource blk, 
  ami = "ami-04b70fa74e45c3917"  #aws_instancee=rsource type
  instance_type = "t2.micro"     #ec2=resourcce name
  
                        
   tags = {
    Name = "FirstEC2"  
    }                   
}
USE UNDER TO CREATE AN EC2 INSTANCE.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
if u use a diff region, d resource will not be provisioned bcos ami is region specific.
But if u are using a data source, it does not matter d region. bcos with data source, it 
will go to what ever region and bring back d ami.

Refactoring is when u create a variable file and put all d varible blks in it, or all 
d output blks in a output file etc.
