create a new dir ec2 and copy and paste provider.tf, resources.tf, data.tf, variables.tf from settings 
to ec2. this is how u reuse resources.
I can run my terra files when i am inside ec2 dir. this ec2 dir bcomes my wking dir.
bcos it is my wking dir, all these files in ec2 make a module. a module is terra configuration
files within a dir. it is in this dir that i can run my terra wkflow.
if i am running my terra commands directly inside ec2, this is what we call a root modules.
bcos i am running my wkflw in d dir that ia am in.
so i can consider ec2 as my module. this is my ec2 module.
it is a module that will create an ec2 instance and a vpc- it is a module bcos it has terra
configuration.
if i want to call this ec2 module, i can create a terra file- main.tf, outside of that module.
to call this module, we use a module block- give it any name=ec2_module.
calling d module, use keyword source. d source of d module is d path were that dir is
in this case my module is in my present wking dir inside a dir called ec2 =./ec2

main.tf
module "ec2_module" {
  source = "./ec2"
}

monka@DESKTOP-0PEDM4P MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/terraform-series (master)
$ ls
ec2/  ec2-02/  main.tf

when i run my code in terraform-sereies it will be reading main.tf. bcos this is d only 
terra file that exist in this dir.
in this main.tf i am calling ec2, 
run terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Initializing modules...
- ec2_module in ec2

it initializses ur backend ie where d terra api is going to be stored, where d terra operations
are going to happen. for our case we have been wking using a local bkend- where when u run
terraform init it downloads ur api into ur local e't.

d second thing it does is it initializws ur modules, it will go and downld ur module - check your 
terra dir under .terraform u will see providers and modules downloaded. and inside d module dir, it has a json 
file that reference d source dirctory of d module.
it means terra will be reading ur code from that dir.

when u run terraform plan, see how it is reading
module.ec2_module.data.aws_ami.ubuntu_ami: Reading...

module.ec2_module.data.aws_ami.ubuntu_ami: Read complete after 0s [id=ami-09040d770ffe2224f]
so it goes to ur modules and read d files to plan ur resources that are 
going to be created.

this ia a benefit that terra provides, u can create modules and refer to them.
so we can be smart, and create a module 4 our vpc and another 4 for our instance
create dir called vpc, and vpc.tf in it.
then goto resource and cut all vpcs and put in vpc.tf.
i can also make this vpc reusable by creating a var file within vpc.tf
in d vpc.tf, - passing cdir as var.
as under.

vpc.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "my_test" {
  cidr_block = var.cidr
  tags = {
    Name = "mydemo-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "main" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.my_test.id
  cidr_block = var.sub_cidr

  tags = {
    Name = "Main"
  }
}

variable "cdir" {
    type = string
    default = "10.0.1.0/16"      
}

variable "sub_cdir" {
    type = string
    default = "10.0.1.0/24"
        
}

d variables confi gured can be cut to d variable.tf in vpc dir.

cp / paste provider from ec2 to main.tf
refactory d provider in ec2 ie provider.tf.md  just rename it so that it will not be read.
d instnce in rsource.tf depends on that subnet
this subnet id comes from a diff module - a diff vpc (create an output here and reference it in ec2).
Crefer or call d output from my module called vpc =module.vpc.subnet_id (module.vpc is just
any name i gave)
to get something outside of a module (in this case d subnet id) we have to create an output.
this is referencing an attribute from a module u have to create an output.
goto resorce.tf in ec2 and call vpc - i have to go out of ec2 dir to dir called vpc
w is now d soruce  ie sourc = "../vpc"
this vpc is a clild module bcs it is being called from a root module.
(i am calling d module output (w is found in my module vpc) from d resource.tf 
d out put created in vpc.tf is called subnet_id, but its value is aws_subnet.main.id,
and i am calling it from d rsorce as -  source = "../vpc"
(thus if u are wking with child module, iu u want to create attribute from that module u 
need to create an output)

vpc.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "my_test" {
  cidr_block = var.cidr
  tags = {
    Name = "mydemo-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "main" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.my_test.id
  cidr_block = var.sub_cidr

  tags = {
    Name = "Main"
  }
}

output "subnet_id" {
  value = aws_subnet.main.id
}

output "subnet_id" {
    value = aws_subnet.main.id
}

resource "aws_instance" "test_ec2" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_ami.id
  instance_type = var.my_instance_type["dev"]
  subnet_id     = module.vpc.subnet_id          //this is d root module 

  #depends_on    = [aws_vpc.my_test]
  tags = {
    Name = var.my_instance_name
  }
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "../vpc"
}

next goto main.tf to also call this vpc module as a child module.
see under

main.tf 
module "ec2_module" {
  source = "./ec2"
}

module "vpc" {                        // child module
    source = "./vpc"
}

terraform {
  required_version = "~> 1.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

resource.tf in ec2
resource "aws_instance" "test_ec2" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_ami.id
  instance_type = var.my_instance_type["dev"]
  subnet_id     = module.vpc.subnet_id

  #depends_on    = [aws_vpc.my_test]
  tags = {
    Name = var.my_instance_name
  }
}

do terraform initialize to downld my vpc

next suppose i want d Name of my aws_vpc to reflect an  app name, team (w team is it devops, engr team
hr, finance etc), d e't dev, staging prod?
to achieve this i can create multiple variables in variables.tf (vpc dir) as below
Aftr that i can create a locals block  - i don't want to pass this long name as a name to my vpc
so this so this is why locals block comes in. inlocals bk u can define long names that u want 
to reference to but u don't want to keep referencing this name in ur code.
after that i will goto my vpc.tf in vpc dir and say Name= local.vpc_name, - i am refering to d key
w is Name in my locals bk in variables.tf.
so if i want to change d name of d vpc to finance, i simply go to my variable division bk and
and change default to finance. same applies to other e't.

this modulw that we are creating is called a custom module bcos we are creating it.

Tell me what u have dome with terra
with terra i have created custom modules, whereby i am writing codes, formating it.
i copy codes from d reg.but i customize it to meet our needs.
we push these custom modules to our repo, once we push them we now call them or make 
reference to them.

d other type of modules are terraform  official modules. terraform.io>registry>browse modules>
if i want to create a terraform vpc module> click on it>can just copy this under provision instructions

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "5.8.1"
}
i can create a dir called official_modules w a file main.tf, paste above there.

d source is terraform official reg and version 5.8.1.
cd into official_modules
terraform init    it downloads that module from d reg.
goto official_modules, u will see d .terraform dir, when i open it i have modules
when i open d module i see d vpc module downloaded and all other resoruces that 
comes with d vpc.
if u use like this y are using it as it is. scroll down to check 
imputs (225), and out puts(things u can get out of that module).
d sorce code of this module lives in github, click it (just above d Examples.
open main.tf they have defined everything for that module -check locals bk.
scroll to #VPC
U SEE that d module is being created as a resource
they are using count

resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
  count = local.create_vpc ? 1 : 0
the ? is checking if local.create_public_subnets && ... had been set to true.
if true then create 1 vpc, if false create 0
so this operand ? is checking d condition
either true or false.
there is a locals bk that has been defined
and is checking that particular condition.
scroll down and look for it.
see d many variables that has been written
to create that vpc.

look at version, and output
if u want to use d module as it is u can use
d one from d provision instructions one.









terraform init
terraform fmt --recursive  - will format all files in all d terraform directories.
terraform validate
