1) def a terra block
version 3 numbrs  a.b.c
a major ver: if something totally new is introduced - there are breaking changes in the Terraform language syntax, configuration format, or provider APIs.
d major ver is updated. 1.5.8 to 2.0.0  d minor and patch ver revert to zero

b minor ver:   Minor versions often include new functionality, improvements to existing features, or additions to provider capabilities., d minor ver. wil be updated say 1.5.8 to 1.6.0     d patch is revert to zero

c patch ver:  incrementing the patch version number usually indicates bug fixes, performance improvements, or other changes that do not affect the overall functionality or API compatibility.
Patch versions are typically backward compatible, and upgrading to a new patch version should not introduce any breaking changes or require modifications to existing configurations.
Patch versions are primarily released to address issues and ensure stability.everytime there is a patch this will be updated. say 1.5.7 to 1.5.8

 required_version = "~> 1.0" # which means any version equal & above 1.0 like 1.1, 1.2 etc and < 2.xx
 we should pay attention to terra vers when creating or maging our resources.
 if u don't specify d ver. terra revert to d latest ver.
 for flexibility we constraint it to d minor version. this is same for d ver for 
 aws passed inside d terra provider

  2) after constraining d ver of terra to use. next determine ur provider
if u don't pass d region and credential then d default region and default
credentials will be used.
3) next is d resource
4)
