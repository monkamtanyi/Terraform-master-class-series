Tell me what u have dome with terraform:

with terra i have created custom modules, whereby i am writing codes, formating it.
I copy codes from d registry and i customize it to meet my needs.
we push these custom modules to our repo, once we push them we now call them or make 
reference to them.

Managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code 
It is platform agnostic - can manage a heterogeneous environment - multi cloud. u can
use it on multiple clouds or e't or providers - aws,dk, k8s, azure etc that's why terraf. thrives.
State management - creates a state file when a project is first initialized.
Uses this state file to create plans and make changes based on the desired 
and current state of the infrastructure. when u have ur configuration file, 
terra will use to to create a state file w it uses to mge ur configuration.
